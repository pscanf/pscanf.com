Back in 2014 Meteor was making headlines as a killer Full Stack javascript
framework, and I fell in love with its model for developing real time APIs.
However, I really disliked its frontend framework Spark, and later its
replacement Blaze. On the client I wanted to use AngularJS, or React.

So naturally I set out to write an alternative, framework-agnostic javascript
client. It turned out I wasn't the only one wishing for such a client, and the
project gained a bit of popularity, becoming (and still being to this day) my
most-starred project on GitHub.
