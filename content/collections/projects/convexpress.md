How do you structure an Express project? How do you validate input parameters?
How do you generate a Swagger definition for the implemented API? Express is a
low-level framework, and these questions are purposefully left unanswered,
allowing its community to come up with many solutions for many use cases.
**convexpress** is one such solution, establishing a set of _lightweight_ and
_straightforward_ conventions for structuring Express projects, and offering
developers a series of facilities when they follow them.
