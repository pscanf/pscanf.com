A mock server is an _incredibly_ useful tool when developing frontend
applications. There are many great open source mock servers, each with its own
ideal use case, its pain points, and its compromises. **mock-server** is another
one of them, employing a code-over-configuration approach and trading automation
(developers _have to_ write their mock endpoints' logic) for flexibility
(developers _can_ write their mock endpoint's logic).
