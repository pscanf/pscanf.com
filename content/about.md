I'm Paolo Scanferla, a freelance software developer from Italy, currently living
in Lithuania and working remotely for most of my time.

My main specialties are frontend development with [React](https://reactjs.org/),
backend development with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and javascript tooling.

I don't like to write about my _amazing professional qualities_ (/s), so I'll
just showcase some of my open source projects and let them speak for me
(positively or negatively).
